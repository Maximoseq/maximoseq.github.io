### Real-Time Fisheries Compliance & Alert System
- This project involved designing a real-time fisheries compliance system to ensure that there is minimal unintentional illegal fishing. As a team, we identified the scope of the fisheries compliance system by designing workflows for fishing vessels and identifying common scenarios for illegal activities, which translated to user stories, epics, and requirements. We used Azure DevOps to manage documentation, backlogs, and objectives, as well as designing workflows, alerts, and notifications.
