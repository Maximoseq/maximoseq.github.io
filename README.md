## Selected Works

### Real-Time Fisheries Compliance & Alert System
- This project involved designing a real-time fisheries compliance system to ensure that there is minimal unintentional illegal fishing. As a team, we identified the scope of the fisheries compliance system by designing workflows for fishing vessels and identifying common scenarios for illegal activities, which translated to user stories, epics, and requirements. We used Azure DevOps to manage documentation, backlogs, and objectives, as well as designing workflows, alerts, and notifications.

### Gallae - Music app
- This project required creating a UX/UI-inspired music event discovery tool and community app that allows users to connect through shared interests in concert and festival events. As a team, we undertook research and analysis on the product, creating a user journey through event participation, discovery, and post-event engagement. We worked together on information architecture, UI design, and personalization strategies, ultimately creating a high-fidelity interactive prototype that includes event-based communities, badges such as language and music taste, and safety-conscious moderation.

### SecondStep - Community Resource Hub (DubHacks Prototype)
- SecondStep is a community-focused prototype that aims to assist people in locating essential resources in their communities, such as food support, shelter, and legal services. The application was developed with the goal of not only assisting people in crisis but also those with limited cognitive knowledge, focusing on simplicity, visual guidance, and low-barrier interaction patterns. As part of the design process, I conducted an interview with a volunteer who assists people with pro bono lawyers in cases involving individuals in domestic violence situations, and the input further emphasized the need to simplify access to resources that many people may not even be aware of.

 ### Looking For Dawgs – Study Group Platform
- Looking For Dawgs is a client-side study group web application developed to assist UW students in finding collaborative study groups. The application was developed using React, JSX, HTML, and CSS, ensuring a clean component structure, a readable layout, and a good interactive flow. A critical component of the platform is the interactive question-and-answer discussion area where students can contribute questions, answers to questions, and upvote answers that are particularly insightful. This was achieved through the use of Firebase, ensuring that questions and upvotes developed during the local development phase are shared in real-time, promoting engagement while keeping it simple and student-centric.
